Future ideas for this project:

==> use transformation to make it 3-D look, also use animation as fly-in

==> Keeping history

==> Edit history and submit

==> C vs CE any difference?


——OK——

==> How to manage precision (# decimal places) and max number of digits
    on LCD, many trailing 0s after decimal doesn’t look good
	(partially solved using DecimalFormat.js )

==> Stop allowing user entry after entering 10 digits

==> Why getting NaN occasionally but hard to capture the use case?
	(1) click digits, +, = (2) … =, +, digits, =
